# BINGO
A novel neural network pruning mechanism that has been awarded MIT THINK semifinalist (1.75% accepted as semifinalists)

BINGO is far faster than other neural network pruning mechanisms, such as IMP. This reduces the price of pruning large neural networks by millions of dollars. This not only aids companies in being able to afford neural network pruning but also helps the environment by making pruning less environmentally and computationally taxing.

The proposal for BINGO, which placed in the top 1.75% of MIT THINK proposals nationwide, can be found in the files, as well as a BINGO vs IMP comparative. The work is still in progress.
