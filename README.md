# BINGO
A novel neural network pruning mechanism that has been awarded MIT THINK semifinalist (1.75% accepted as semifinalists)

BINGO is far faster than other neural network pruning mechanisms, such as IMP. This reduces the price of pruning large neural networks by millions of dollars. This not only aids companies in being able to afford neural network pruning but also helps the environment by making pruning less environmentally and computationally taxing.

In short, BINGO improves upon existing pruning mechanisms by doing something truly unique - pruning based on information learned during the training session. BINGO collects information about which weights are significant to a model during the original training session, and then using that information, it prunes insignificant neurons with one shot after training is complete. This results in far faster, less computationally-taxing, less environmentally-threatening pruning than  other state-of-the-art pruning mechanisms.

The proposal for BINGO, which placed in the top 1.75% of MIT THINK proposals nationwide, can be found in the files, as well as a BINGO vs IMP comparative. The work is still in progress.
